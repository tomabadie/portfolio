# Portfolio – Thomas Abadie

Welcome to my personal portfolio, available at [tomabadie.dev](https://www.tomabadie.dev).  
It was designed to showcase my background, my projects, and my journey as a former materials science engineer and teacher, now transitioning into tech as a junior developer.

---

## Overview

This project reflects my goal of creating a clean, fast, subtly animated, and above all, **accessible** user experience.  
Although I’m still a beginner, I strive to follow best practices with a strong focus on **clean code**, **clear structure**, and **web accessibility** (contrast, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation…).

The site is fully handcrafted using React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.
